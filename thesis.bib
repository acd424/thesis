    abstract = "This article explores the potential for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable a more effective, prevention focused and less confrontational policing model that has hitherto been too resource consuming to implement at scale. Problem-Oriented Policing (POP) is a potential replacement, at least in part, for traditional policing which adopts a reactive approach, relying heavily on the criminal justice system. By contrast, POP seeks to prevent crime by manipulating the underlying conditions that allow crimes to be committed. Identifying these underlying conditions requires a detailed understanding of crime events - tacit knowledge that is often held by police officers but which can be challenging to derive from structured police data. One potential source of insight exists in unstructured free text data commonly collected by police for the purposes of investigation or administration. Yet police agencies do not typically have the skills or resources to analyse these data at scale. In this article we argue that NLP offers the potential to unlock these unstructured data and by doing so allow police to implement more POP initiatives. However we caution that using NLP models without adequate knowledge may either allow or perpetuate bias within the data potentially leading to unfavourable outcomes.",

@article{popeffective,
abstract = "Research We conducted a Campbell systematic review to examine the effectiveness of problem‐oriented policing (POP) in reducing crime and disorder. After an exhaustive search strategy that identified more than 5,500 articles and reports, we found only ten methodologically rigorous evaluations that met our inclusion criteria. Using meta‐analytic techniques, we found an overall modest but statistically significant impact of POP on crime and disorder. We also report on our analysis of pre/post comparison studies. Although these studies are less methodologically rigorous, they are more numerous. The results of these studies indicate an overwhelmingly positive impact from POP. Policy Implications POP has been adopted widely across police agencies and has been identified as effective by many policing scholars. Our study supports the overall commitment of police to POP but suggests that we should not necessarily expect large crime and disorder control benefits from this approach. Moreover, funders and the police need to invest much greater effort and resources to identify the specific approaches and tactics that work best in combating specific types of crime problems. We conclude that the evidence base in this area is deficient given the strong investment in POP being made by the government and police agencies.",

After a brief introduction, the paper describes the concept of problem-oriented policing (POP), first proposed in 1979. It goes on to assess the extent to which the police have adopted POP, and its current status. POP is, in the immediate sense, aimed at a reduction in the incidence or severity of the problem on which attention is focused, and, in the broader sense, at improving the fundamentals of policing in a democratic society.",

Unfortunately, annotations are not available in other languages. Could a model that detects negation scope be applied to a language that it hasn't been trained on? We develop neural models that learn from cross-lingual word embeddings or universal dependencies in English, and test them on Chinese, showing that they work surprisingly well. We find that modelling syntax is helpful even in monolingual settings and that cross-lingual word embeddings help relatively little, and we analyse cases that are still difficult for this task.},

abstract = "A recent promise to access unstructured clinical data from electronic health records on large-scale has revitalized the interest in automated de-identification of clinical notes, which includes the identification of mentions of Protected Health Information (PHI). We describe the methods developed and evaluated as part of the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 challenge to identify PHI defined by 25 entity types in longitudinal clinical narratives. Our approach combines knowledge-driven (dictionaries and rules) and data-driven (machine learning) methods with a large range of features to address de-identification of specific named entities. In addition, we have devised a two-pass recognition approach that creates a patient-specific run-time dictionary from the PHI entities identified in the first step with high confidence, which is then used in the second pass to identify mentions that lack specific clues. The proposed method achieved the overall micro F1-measures of 91\% on strict and 95\% on token-level evaluation on the test dataset (514 narratives). Whilst most PHI entities can be reliably identified, particularly challenging were mentions of Organizations and Professions. Still, the overall results suggest that automated text mining methods can be used to reliably process clinical notes to identify personal information and thus providing a crucial step in large-scale de-identification of unstructured data for further clinical and epidemiological studies."

However, we find that these successes sometimes lead to hype in which these models are being described as {``}understanding{''} language or capturing {``}meaning{''}. In this position paper, we argue that a system trained only on form has a priori no way to learn meaning. In keeping with the ACL 2020 theme of {``}Taking Stock of Where We{'}ve Been and Where We{'}re Going{''}, we argue that a clear understanding of the distinction between form and meaning will help guide the field towards better science around natural language understanding.",

	abstract = {We present a novel exploratory application of unsupervised machine-learning methods to identify clusters of specific crime problems from unstructured modus operandi free-text data within a single administrative crime classification. To illustrate our proposed approach, we analyse police recorded free-text narrative descriptions of residential burglaries occurring over a two-year period in a major metropolitan area of the UK. Results of our analyses demonstrate that topic modelling algorithms are capable of clustering substantively different burglary problems without prior knowledge of such groupings. Subsequently, we describe a prototype dashboard that allows replication of our analytical workflow and could be applied to support operational decision making in the identification of specific crime problems. This approach to grouping distinct types of offences within existing offence categories, we argue, has the potential to support crime analysts in proactively analysing large volumes of modus operandi free-text data—with the ultimate aims of developing a greater understanding of crime problems and supporting the design of tailored crime reduction interventions.},

This paper reviews the demand on a division within a police service in England over the period of a year. Utilising police data records, it combined descriptive statistics with content analysis to identify areas of demand. Findings revealed that the majority of the Constabulary’s resources were spent addressing non-traditional police demand. Results indicate that the police could potentially reduce demand for service by enhancing work within two key areas: partnership working and early intervention. }

International research conducted since that date is also reviewed. The paper finds that seriousness of the offence is still the most important factor influencing victims’ decisions. But reporting rates have changed: broadly, property crime is less likely to be reported whereas violent crime is more likely to be reported. As property crime predominates, the overall trend has been downward. There has been a very notable shift in that crimes committed by family members and others well known to the victim are much more likely to be reported than previously.}",

abstract = {This paper tackles the difficult but important task of objective algorithm performance assessment for optimization. Rather than reporting average performance of algorithms across a set of chosen instances, which may bias conclusions, we propose a methodology to enable the strengths and weaknesses of different optimization algorithms to be compared across a broader instance space. The results reported in a recent Computers and Operations Research paper comparing the performance of graph coloring heuristics are revisited with this new methodology to demonstrate (i) how pockets of the instance space can be found where algorithm performance varies significantly from the average performance of an algorithm; (ii) how the properties of the instances can be used to predict algorithm performance on previously unseen instances with high accuracy; and (iii) how the relative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm can be visualized and measured objectively.}

    abstract = "BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019) has achieved significant progress in several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks by leveraging the multi-head self-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) in its architecture. However, it still has several research challenges which are not tackled well for domain specific corpus found in industries. In this paper, we have highlighted these problems through detailed experiments involving analysis of the attention scores and dynamic word embeddings with the BERT-Base-Uncased model. Our experiments have lead to interesting findings that showed: 1) Largest substring from the left that is found in the vocabulary (in-vocab) is always chosen at every sub-word unit that can lead to suboptimal tokenization choices, 2) Semantic meaning of a vocabulary word deteriorates when found as a substring in an Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) word, and 3) Minor misspellings in words are inadequately handled. We believe that if these challenges are tackled, it will significantly help the domain adaptation aspect of BERT.",
