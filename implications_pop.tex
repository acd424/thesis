\section{Introduction} This chapter is the first chapter in the third and final part of this thesis. The aim of this part of the thesis is to draw together the lessons from the previous two parts and then asses what they mean for the future of POP and NLP.  This chapter will synthesise the results form the previous studies and describe what implications they have for Problem-oriented policing(POP). The following chapter will look more broadly at the possible future research directions for NLP with police data.
