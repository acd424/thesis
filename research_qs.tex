\chapter{Aims and Objectives} This chapter follows on from the introduction of the main research areas and the identified gaps in the existing literature and provides an overview of the primary research aim investigated and a proposed outline of how each research question will be addressed. Firstly it will explore the overall question of what techniques can be used to extract information and  what practical applications does it have. Then the research sub-question will be restated before a detailed review into how each question might be explored.  As a key driver of the research will be data availability, there is a brief note on that first.

\section{Primary Research Aim}
The thesis will be motivated by the following overarching research question: 

\emph{Can PTMs be used efficiently to extract information from police free-text data, and if so what practical applications for problem-oriented policing does this approach have?}

With supporting objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify the extent of NLP usage with police data.

\item Evaluate how effective PTMs are with MO data.

\item Evaluate how effective PTMs are with Police Incident data.

\item Evaluate how effective Active learning is with police data.

\item Identify which parts of the POP process might be best supported by the use of PTMs.

\item Identify implementation barriers for PTMs.

\end{itemize}

\section{Primary Research Question}

\emph{Can PTMs be used to extract information from police free-text data, and if so what practical applications for problem-oriented policing does this approach have?}

\subsection{Aim} 

The overarching aim of this study is to extend investigation into the effectiveness of NLP methods in analysing police free text data. There will be a focus on how modern PTMs can be used to classify police texts. This classification will enable a greater understanding of intra-crime variation and so may provide novel insights into the specificity of problems, thus supporting the application of POP. 



\subsection{Discussion} 

The previous chapters have discussed how POP focuses on specificity in identifying  and understanding problems. Subsequently, the challenges associated with conducting the POP process were discussed. It was highlighted that free text data, while rich in content, was often under utilised in this process due to a range of logistical challenges. 

Chapter 5 discussed how a diverse range NLP methods can be used to extract meaningful insights from free text data, and how fruitful applications of these methods have been observed in a range of domains. More recently NLP techniques have developed to produce a class of models known as pre-trained language models (PTMs). PTMs are able to analyse texts with little additional feature engineering. These models have proved themselves useful with established academic test sets, but as of yet they have not knowingly been tested against police generated data. If the PTMs are able to effectively analyse police generated data, then it is likely that they will be able to alleviate some of the time consuming analytical processes in POP. 

When considering if PTMs \emph{can} be used to extract information from police free text data, there are wider concerns other than just accuracy of the model. Therefore I will also be considering other factors that allow a technique, especially an AI technique, to be used in a public service capacity. The additional factors will be model bias and explainability. These factors that were introduced at the end of Chapter 6 and were seen as important factors to track to understand if a model was suitable for use.

The next sections will introduced the objectives stated above that will be explored in order to answer the main research question. 



\section{Supporting Objectives} 




\subsection{Identify the extent of NLP usage with police data.}  This was already completed in the previous chapter by way of a literature survey.  As a brief recap it was found that NLP techniques have been used with police generated data, both academically and practically. However the NLP work is not extensive and no work with PTMs has been recorded. This sets the research objective of reviewing the performance of PTMs with police generated data. To understand how these PTMs can be used with little additional manipulation and what results they will offer. 

The next two objectives will focus on the use of PTMs with two different text types. The two different types are Modus Operandi (MO) data and police incident logs. These data types were briefly introduced in the Introduction, and will be described more fully in the Data Chapter. 

\subsection{Evaluate how effective PTMs are with MO data.} MO data is a short description of a crime. MO data records aspects of intra-crime variation for each crime an so can be a useful source of information for POP practitioners. This objective will investigate how well PTM models can extract this intra-crime variation. The evaluation of this objective will be conducted in Study 1. Study 1 will focus on MO data, in particular burglary MO data. Model effectiveness  will encompass  performance, explainability and the presence (or absence) of bias.  In addition where data availability allows, performance over time and across police forces will be investigated. Performance over time is important because effort spent building models that last longer will be more efficient. Performance across police forces is important because wider use of a single model means more efficient use of the resources required to build the model.   

\subsection{Evaluate how effective PTMs are with police incident data.} Police MO data is not the only data that describes crimes. Another ubiquitous source of data is police incident logs. For this reason PTM effectiveness will also be judged against police incident logs. In particular police incident logs describing anti-social behaviour (ASB). Choosing another text type is important because different texts are formed in different ways and can use different language. These linguistic differences may mean that PTM effectiveness changes between text types.  

\subsection{Evaluate how effective Active Learning is with police data.} Using PTMs generally requires labelled data. Labelled data however requires resource to generate. Resource that would otherwise be applied to POP problem soling in other ways. One method that has been developed to reduce this resource requirement is Active Learning.  In keeping with lowering the burden on POP, Active Learning will be investigated to understand what kind of efficiencies can be achieved by adopting the technique.

\subsection{Identify which parts of the POP process might be best supported by the use of PTMs.} The proceeding three supporting objectives will form the middle part of the thesis. This final supporting objective will review what has been learned in that middle part of the thesis and then suggest how the POP burden may be lowered. This analysis will be achieved using the SARA framework. The SARA framework is a framework for implementing POP that was introduced in Chapter 3.

\subsection{Identify implementation barriers for PTMs.} Introducing any new practice or software is likely to hit barriers. These barriers can stop a new practice being implemented if they are not identified and addressed. This  supporting objective will highlight the most important barriers, suggesting how they may be over come.
