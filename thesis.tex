\parencite{maguire2015problem} This is the article with review of 753 cases in colorado. Although the data is old, they only investigated cases from 1995 to 99 they highlight three issues with implementation 1) Police partners do not play a big role, 2) Inconsistent record keeping makes institutional learning about what works difficult, 3) Evaluations were sporadic and porrly conducted. They conclude in part that 'Police Agencies may simply not have the capacity to implement the analytical elements of POP"

One commander, reflecting on the poor performance in Iraq lamented the fact that he could spend thousands of pounds on missiles to kill a single person - but was not empowered to spend a fraction of that money in creating work to
but in more complex security environments they become even more meaningless. In these cases  counting mundane elements such as tomatoes can be more beneficial than offenders neutralised.


There have been  to 'improve' on the SARA model. XXX et al have suggested changing the model to SPATIAL as it allows to bring into the cycle a greater understanding of xxx. Eblokom (2015) has suggested the 5Is( Intelligence, Intervention, Implementation, Involvement, Impact) as a way of improving the POP implementation. But none of them have usurped the SARA model which seems to be the most popular and flexible.


in fact \parencite{sidebottom2020implementing} have said that say{The development of specialist analysts should be a key feature of a problem-oriented organisation. } which serves to highlight the need for specialist skills in the POP team.

v
The ten points of the modus operandi system
The points to be borne in mind when collecting information for the system are:
Style the style of deception used in criminal deception cases, e.g. dressed as a church minister, documents claiming to be an insurance collector
Time relative to an event (not to the clock), e.g. only on market days, early closing days, on certain days of the months
Objective the objective of the crime, e.g. gain, lust, revenge
Pal accomplice or friend
Class the class of person or property attacked
Reason reason for being in the area, the criminal’s self-account,
Instrument instrument used to commit the crime, e.g. crowbar, could be unusual bodily force (sitting on victim)
Mode mode of transport used to commit the crimes 
Entry the actual point where entry was made
Signature something unusual done by the criminal, their ‘signature’, e.g. creates an escape route by wedging doors open, closes curtains, ejaculates into women’s underwear, defecates.
